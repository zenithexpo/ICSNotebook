##Cryptography conceals data against unauthorized access
- Consider the steps involved in sending messages from a sender, S, to a recipient, R. If
S entrusts the message to T, who then delivers it to R, T then becomes the transmission
medium. If an outsider, O, wants to access the message (to read, change, or even destroy
it), we call O an interceptor or intruder. Any time after S transmits the message via T, it
is vulnerable to exploitation, and O might try to access it in any of the following ways:
• block it, by preventing its reaching R, thereby affecting the availability of the
message
• intercept it, by reading or listening to the message, thereby affecting the
confidentiality of the message
• modify it, by seizing the message and changing it in some way, affecting the
message’s integrity
• fabricate an authentic-looking message, arranging for it to be delivered as if it
came from S, thereby also affecting the integrity of the message
